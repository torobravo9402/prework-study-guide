        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>Use HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frame’s building blocks.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience.</li>
          <li>Inspect the parent < body > element and its child elements, and reverse engineer the code. In doing so, you will analyze how they structure the webpage's content.</li>
          <li>The < body > element is an example of a semantic HTML element. </li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. </li>
          <li>Use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The < ul >, < ol >, and < li > elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Need to create an external style sheet with CSS.</li>
          <li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing. CSS can also make a website simpler to use with a polished design and consistent organization.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp.</li>
          <li>Patience and a systematic approach are key to successfully identifying and fixing bugs in your code.</li>
          <li>Link the style sheet to the HTML.</li>
          <li>External style sheet, added CSS, and connected the style sheet to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>used HTML elements such as < header >, < footer >, and < h1 > as selectors in the external style sheet and then applied CSS properties to style them.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Use the class selector, card, to style each topic in our Prework Study Guide. </li>
          <li>The .card selector contains width, margin, border, and box-shadow properties.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          
          <li>Examined basic JavaScript features, such as variables, strings, and data types.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</li>
          <li>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</li>
          <li>Declarations: JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations: var, let, const.</li>
          <li>var: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
          <li>let: Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
          <li>const: Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</li>
          <li>Variables: You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</li>
          <li>A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 – 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).</li>
          <li>You can use most Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. </li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
