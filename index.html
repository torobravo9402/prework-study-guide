          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>Use HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frameâ€™s building blocks.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience.</li>
          <li>Inspect the parent < body > element and its child elements, and reverse engineer the code. In doing so, you will analyze how they structure the webpage's content.</li>
          <li>The < body > element is an example of a semantic HTML element. </li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. </li>
          <li>Use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The < ul >, < ol >, and < li > elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
